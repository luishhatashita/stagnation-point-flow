# Usage

The only requirement is a fortran compiler, e.g. gnufortran (add link).

1. clone the repository;
2. compile the main file ('gnufortran main.f90')
3. run the executable a.out

The outputs are:

1. a .txt file with the data to be further plot

# Test cases

In order to validate the code application of both methods 4th order Runge-Kutta and the Bisection method, the following test cases are suggested:

- asdf
- adsf

To run the test cases:

1. run the main.f90 -t 'RK' for the 4th order Runge-Kutta, or main.f90 -t 'BM' for the bisection method;
2. the respective results will be presented after the new compiled file is run.
